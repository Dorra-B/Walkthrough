# Walkthrough By Dorra Boukari

This walkthrough lab is attached to the paper entitled" Docker On AWS Summary " in which I summarized the AWS Whitepaper written by Brandon Chavis and Thomas Jones.

This lab helps you to create your first cluster. You will create, register and run a task definition, and finally you will deploy a container.
Here you will launch  NGINX webserver inside an ECS container using an ECS task and a community dockerfile.
I really recommand this paper especially for beginners.

PS:
- The needed commands at each step are written and commented in the provided bash script which can be useful the automate sequences of commands.
- A complete shell script must be executable to run .You have to use chmod to add the execute permission to the file. 
- If you want to grant script execute permissions only for intended users you can use chown.
-If you want to invoke the shell script using thename alone, you need to place the script in one of the directories listed in the shell's PATH environmental variable.You can invoke a shell script by entering a path name to the script on the command line.
Practice makes perfect. Good luck.
