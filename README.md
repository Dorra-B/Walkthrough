# Walkthrough
This is a walkthrough attached to the AWS Whitepaper entitled" Docker On AWS Summary "

It helps you to create your first cluster. You will create, register and run a task definition, and finally you will deploy a container.
Here you will launch  NGINX webserver inside an ECS container using an ECS task and a community dockerfile.
I really recommand this paper especially for beginners.

Practice makes perfect. Good luck.
